        "Using platforms like GitHub enhances computational reproducibility in immunology research by providing centralized repositories for code, data, and analysis workflows. With GitHubâ€™s version control system, researchers can track every change made to their scripts and datasets, ensuring transparency in how computational methods evolve over time. This detailed history allows for easier replication of experiments, as previous versions can be accessed and reviewed. By publishing repositories publicly, immunologists also make their work accessible for peer validation and reuse, which strengthens the credibility of findings. Additionally, GitHub encourages best practices like thorough documentation and testing, ensuring that computational tools are reliable and reproducible across different environments.\n"
